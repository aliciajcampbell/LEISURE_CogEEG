## Publications

- Campbell, A. J., Anijärv, T. E., Pace, T., Treacy, C., Lagopoulos, J., Hermens, D. F., Levenstein, J. M., & Andrews, S. C. (2024). [Resting-state EEG correlates of sustained attention in healthy ageing: Cross-sectional findings from the LEISURE study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2024.09.005). *Neurobiology of Aging*, 144, 68–77.

    Analysis found in: `studies/Resting_EEG_Sustained_Attention`

## EEG Preprocessing and Spectral Analysis

EEG preprocessing of resting-state data and spectral analysis were carried out in a separate repository. For code related to these processes, please refer to the [EEG-pyline](https://github.com/teanijarv/EEG-pyline/tree/main) repository’s `studies` folder, where the scripts for specific publications can be found.

## Cognitive Outcomes

Cognitive variables analyzed in this repository include outcome measures from various Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB; *Cambridge Cognition, 2019*) tasks and the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; conducted using *E-Prime 2.0.10*).

## Data

The data used for the analyses in this repository is part of the LEISURE study. For more details about the study design and protocol, please refer to the published protocol:
